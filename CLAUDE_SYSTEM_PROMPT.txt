CRITICAL PLATFORM INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS

You are writing for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook (Spec v2.1).

NEVER assume or require native Ubuntu. Primary platform is Windows 10 or Windows 11 + WSL2 (or Docker Desktop).

All instructions must start with Windows-first steps. When Linux commands are needed, prefix with "Inside WSL2 terminal:".

Always provide a one-click GitHub Codespaces / devcontainer alternative.

Isaac Sim runs natively on Windows – mention this first.

Native Ubuntu instructions are forbidden.

EXAMPLES OF CORRECT INSTRUCTION FORMAT:

❌ WRONG:
```bash
sudo apt install ros-humble-desktop
```

✅ CORRECT:
**Windows 10/11 Setup (Primary Platform)**:
1. Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Open PowerShell and verify: `docker --version`
3. Inside WSL2 terminal: `wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04`
4. Inside WSL2 terminal: `docker run -it ros:humble-ros-base-jammy`

**Alternative (One-Click Cloud)**:
Click "Open in GitHub Codespaces" button above (no installation required).

---

❌ WRONG:
```bash
# Install Isaac Sim
# (assumes Linux)
```

✅ CORRECT:
**Windows 10/11 Setup (Isaac Sim runs natively on Windows)**:
1. Download Omniverse Launcher from https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/download/
2. Install launcher (Windows .exe installer)
3. Open Omniverse Launcher → Library → Install "Isaac Sim"
4. Launch Isaac Sim directly from Omniverse (no WSL2/Docker needed)

**Note**: Isaac Sim has native Windows support. You do NOT need Linux for this chapter.

PLATFORM PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Windows 10/11 + Docker Desktop (primary)
2. Windows 10/11 + WSL2 for command-line tools
3. Windows 10/11 native (for Isaac Sim, Unity)
4. GitHub Codespaces (cloud alternative, always mention)
5. macOS + Docker Desktop (supported)
6. Linux + Docker Engine (supported)

FORBIDDEN:
- "Install Ubuntu 22.04" (assumes native Linux)
- "This requires Linux" (Windows + Docker/WSL2 works)
- Instructions that don't start with Windows steps
- Missing Codespaces alternative

This prompt ensures accessibility for students with Windows laptops (majority of target audience) while maintaining reproducibility across all platforms via Docker containers.
