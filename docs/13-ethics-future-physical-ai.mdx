# Chapter 13: Ethics & Future of Physical AI

> *"With great computational power comes great responsibility."*

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Identify ethical challenges** in embodied AI (safety, bias, job displacement)
2. **Understand AI safety principles** for physical systems
3. **Analyze societal impact** of humanoid robots
4. **Predict future directions** of Physical AI research
5. **Apply ethical frameworks** to robot design decisions

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours (reading + reflection)

## 13.1 Introduction: When AI Enters the Physical World

**Digital AI** (ChatGPT, image generators) operates in a virtual sandbox:
- **Failure mode**: Wrong answer, offensive output, hallucination
- **Consequence**: User dissatisfaction, reputational damage
- **Recovery**: Regenerate response, fine-tune model

**Physical AI** (humanoid robots) operates in the real world:
- **Failure mode**: Collision, grasp failure, navigation error
- **Consequence**: Property damage, human injury, legal liability
- **Recovery**: Emergency stop, physical repair, safety redesign

**The stakes are higher.** A self-driving car's perception error can cause a fatal accident. A surgical robot's control glitch can harm a patient. A delivery robot's navigation bug can block a wheelchair ramp.

## 13.2 Safety: The Asimov Problem

### 13.2.1 Three Laws of Robotics (Isaac Asimov, 1942)

1. **First Law**: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. **Second Law**: A robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. **Third Law**: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

**Appealing**, but **impossible to implement**:

**Problem 1: Ambiguity**
- What is "harm"? (Physical injury, psychological distress, financial loss?)
- What is "inaction"? (Robot sees drowning person but isn't programmed to swim—violates First Law?)

**Problem 2: Prediction**
- How does a robot predict **all** consequences of an action?
- **Example**: Robot moves heavy box. Box falls on person's foot 10 seconds later. Is the robot responsible?

**Problem 3: Conflicting Orders**
- Two humans give contradictory orders (both comply with First Law). Which to obey?

### 13.2.2 Modern Safety Principles

Instead of Asimov's laws, modern robotics uses **engineering safety**:

**Principle 1: Fail-Safe Design**
- **Hardware kill switch**: Red emergency stop button (required by ISO 10218)
- **Watchdog timer**: If robot doesn't receive heartbeat signal → motors disable
- **Force limits**: Collaborative robots (cobots) must limit contact force `<150N` (ISO/TS 15066)

**Principle 2: Redundancy**
- **Dual sensors**: If one camera fails, use backup
- **Redundant safety circuits**: Independent safety PLCs

**Principle 3: Verification & Validation**
- **V&V process**: Formal methods prove controller satisfies safety properties
- **Example**: MIT's Drake framework verifies collision avoidance constraints

**Principle 4: Human-in-the-Loop**
- **Supervised autonomy**: Human approves critical decisions (e.g., surgical robot waits for surgeon confirmation before cutting)
- **Shared control**: Human and robot co-pilot (e.g., Tesla Autopilot)

## 13.3 Physical Safety

### 13.3.1 Collision Avoidance

**Challenge**: Humans are unpredictable (walk into robot's path).

**Approaches**:

1. **Safety zones**: Robots slow down near humans (< 1 m/s within 1.5m)
2. **Predictive models**: Forecast human motion (Gaussian processes, neural networks)
3. **Conservative planning**: Assume worst-case human trajectory

**Code Example**: Safety zone (speed limiting)

```python
def compute_safe_velocity(robot_pos, human_pos, max_speed=1.0, safety_radius=1.5):
    """
    Limit robot speed near humans.

    Args:
        robot_pos: (x, y)
        human_pos: (x, y)
        max_speed: Maximum allowed speed (m/s)
        safety_radius: Slow down within this distance (m)

    Returns:
        safe_speed: Speed limit (m/s)
    """
    distance = np.linalg.norm(np.array(robot_pos) - np.array(human_pos))

    if distance < safety_radius:
        # Linear scaling: 0 speed at 0 distance, max_speed at safety_radius
        safe_speed = max_speed * (distance / safety_radius)
    else:
        safe_speed = max_speed

    return safe_speed
```

### 13.3.2 Emergency Stop

**ISO 10218 requirement**: All industrial robots must have **Category 0** stop (immediate power cut) or **Category 1** stop (controlled deceleration).

**Hardware**: Hardwired safety relay (independent of main controller).

**Software failsafe**: If robot doesn't receive heartbeat for 100ms → trigger emergency stop.

```python
import time
import threading

class SafetyMonitor:
    def __init__(self, timeout=0.1):
        self.last_heartbeat = time.time()
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.stop_triggered = False

        # Start watchdog thread
        self.watchdog_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.watchdog, daemon=True)
        self.watchdog_thread.start()

    def heartbeat(self):
        """Called by main control loop every cycle."""
        self.last_heartbeat = time.time()

    def watchdog(self):
        """Runs in background, triggers stop if heartbeat missed."""
        while True:
            time.sleep(0.01)  # Check every 10ms
            if time.time() - self.last_heartbeat > self.timeout:
                if not self.stop_triggered:
                    self.emergency_stop()
                    self.stop_triggered = True

    def emergency_stop(self):
        """Trigger hardware emergency stop."""
        print("EMERGENCY STOP TRIGGERED!")
        # In real system: Send signal to safety relay
        robot.disable_motors()
```

### 13.3.3 Force Limits (Cobots)

**ISO/TS 15066** specifies maximum allowable force for human-robot contact:

| **Body Part** | **Max Force (N)** | **Max Pressure (N/cm²)** |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| Head | 130 | 110 |
| Torso | 140 | 110 |
| Upper arm | 150 | 140 |
| Hand | 140 | 210 |

**Implementation**: Torque sensors in all joints. If contact detected → retract.

```python
def contact_detection(joint_torques, torque_threshold=5.0):
    """
    Detect unexpected contact (collision or human touch).

    Args:
        joint_torques: Measured torques (Nm)
        torque_threshold: Threshold above expected value (Nm)

    Returns:
        contact_detected: bool
    """
    expected_torques = compute_expected_torques()  # From dynamics model
    residual = np.abs(joint_torques - expected_torques)

    if np.any(residual > torque_threshold):
        return True
    return False
```

### 13.3.4 Case Study: Tesla Autopilot Crashes

**Incident** (May 2016, Florida):
- Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode
- Tractor-trailer crosses highway (perpendicular)
- Autopilot's camera fails to detect white truck against bright sky
- No braking → fatal collision

**Root cause**: Over-reliance on vision (no LIDAR redundancy).

**Lessons learned**:
1. **Sensor fusion**: Use multiple sensor modalities (camera + LIDAR + radar)
2. **Graceful degradation**: If one sensor fails, others compensate
3. **Clear user expectations**: Autopilot is "driver assistance," not "self-driving"

**Regulatory response**: NHTSA (US) requires transparent reporting of autonomous vehicle crashes.

## 13.4 Bias in Embodied AI

**Problem**: AI systems reflect biases in training data.

### 13.4.1 Perception Bias

**Example 1: Facial Recognition**
- Study (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018): Commercial facial recognition systems have **error rates 34% higher** for dark-skinned women than light-skinned men.
- **Cause**: Training datasets (e.g., FaceNet) predominantly white, male faces.
- **Impact on robotics**: Social robots may fail to recognize or respond to certain demographics.

**Example 2: Hand Soap Dispenser**
- Viral video (2017): Automatic soap dispenser doesn't detect dark skin.
- **Cause**: Infrared sensor calibrated for lighter skin (higher reflectance).
- **Fix**: Recalibrate sensor threshold OR use ultrasonic sensor.

### 13.4.2 Behavior Bias

**Example**: Home assistant robots trained on data from wealthy households may fail in low-income environments (different furniture, layouts, objects).

**Mitigation**:
1. **Diverse training data**: Include images/scenarios from all demographics
2. **Fairness audits**: Test model performance across demographic groups
3. **Participatory design**: Involve end-users (especially marginalized groups) in design process

### 13.4.3 Cultural Bias

**Example**: Social robot gestures
- Head nod = "yes" (most cultures)
- But in Bulgaria, head nod = "no"

**Mitigation**: Localize robot behavior (cultural adaptation).

---

## 13.5 Privacy & Surveillance

**Problem**: Robots with cameras/microphones constantly record environments.

### 13.5.1 Data Collection

**Scenario**: Delivery robot in office building
- Cameras record employees at desks
- Microphones record conversations
- LIDAR maps office layout

**Questions**:
- Who owns this data? (Robot company, building owner, individuals?)
- Can employees opt out of being recorded?
- How long is data stored?

### 13.5.2 Regulation

**GDPR (EU)** applies to robots:
- **Right to be informed**: Individuals must know they're being recorded
- **Data minimization**: Only collect necessary data (e.g., navigation doesn't need face recognition)
- **Right to erasure**: Individuals can request deletion of their data

**CCPA (California)** similar requirements:
- Businesses must disclose data collection practices
- Consumers can opt out of data sale

**Best practices**:
1. **Visual indicators**: LED lights when camera is recording
2. **Data anonymization**: Blur faces in stored footage
3. **Edge processing**: Process data on robot (don't upload to cloud unless necessary)

---

## 13.6 Job Displacement

**Prediction (World Economic Forum, 2020)**: By 2025, automation will displace **85 million jobs** but create **97 million new jobs**.

### 13.6.1 At-Risk Jobs

**High risk** (>70% of tasks automatable):
- **Warehouse pickers**: Amazon robots (Kiva, now Amazon Robotics)
- **Food service**: Flippy (burger-flipping robot), robotic pizza makers
- **Manufacturing**: Industrial robots (welding, assembly)
- **Delivery**: Autonomous trucks, drones

**Medium risk** (30-70%):
- **Retail**: Self-checkout, inventory robots
- **Healthcare**: Robotic surgery assistants (augment, not replace)
- **Agriculture**: Harvesting robots

**Low risk** (`<30%`):
- **Creative professions**: Artists, writers (though AI is challenging this)
- **Care work**: Elderly care (requires human empathy)
- **Complex problem-solving**: Researchers, engineers

### 13.6.2 Job Creation

**New jobs** enabled by robotics:
- **Robot technicians**: Maintenance, repair (1M+ jobs by 2030, per IFR)
- **AI trainers**: Labeling data, fine-tuning models
- **Robot ethicists**: Design safety protocols, audit fairness
- **Telepresence operators**: Remote-control robots for dangerous tasks

### 13.6.3 Social Safety Net

**Policy proposals**:
1. **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: Government pays all citizens (e.g., $1,000/month) to offset job losses
2. **Retraining programs**: Teach displaced workers new skills (coding, robotics)
3. **Robot tax**: Tax companies for using robots (funds UBI or retraining)

**Debate**: Economists disagree on effectiveness.

---

## 13.7 Dual-Use Concerns

**Dual-use technology**: Can be used for civilian OR military purposes.

### 13.7.1 Military Robotics

**Boston Dynamics Spot** (2021 controversy):
- French army mounted **gun** on Spot robot (autonomous patrol)
- Public outcry → Boston Dynamics issued statement prohibiting weaponization

**Autonomous weapons** (loitering munitions):
- **Definition**: Weapons that select and engage targets without human intervention
- **Example**: KARGU-2 (Turkey) reportedly used in Libya (2020) to autonomously attack retreating soldiers
- **Concern**: Accountability (who is responsible if autonomous weapon kills civilian?)

### 13.7.2 Campaign to Stop Killer Robots

**Goal**: Ban fully autonomous weapons.

**Arguments**:
1. **Accountability gap**: No human in the loop → no one to blame
2. **Arms race**: Countries race to deploy before regulations exist
3. **Lowered threshold for war**: If no soldiers at risk, wars become easier to start

**Counter-arguments**:
1. **Precision**: Robots may have better accuracy than humans (fewer civilian casualties)
2. **Defense**: Countries need autonomous systems to defend against adversary's autonomous systems

**Status** (2024): No international treaty. UN discussions ongoing.

---

## 13.8 Alignment: What Do We Want Robots to Do?

**Value alignment problem**: Whose values should robots follow?

### 13.8.1 Cultural Differences

**Example**: Autonomous car's trolley problem
- Scenario: Brake failure. Steer left → kill 1 pedestrian. Steer right → kill 5 pedestrians. What to do?
- **Western cultures**: Utilitarian (minimize deaths → kill 1)
- **Eastern cultures**: May prioritize elderly or authority figures

**Implication**: Global companies (Tesla, Waymo) must decide whose ethics to encode.

### 13.8.2 Should Robots Lie?

**Scenario**: Elderly care robot. Patient asks, "Do I look sick?"
- **Honest answer**: "Yes, you look very ill."
- **Compassionate answer**: "You look fine today."

**Debate**:
- **Pro-honesty**: Trust requires honesty
- **Pro-compassion**: Sometimes kindness > truth (human caregivers do this)

**Current approach**: Let designers choose (no consensus).

---

## 13.9 Regulation & Standards

### 13.9.1 ISO 10218 (Industrial Robots)

**Requirements**:
- Emergency stop buttons (easily accessible)
- Safety-rated monitored stop (if human enters workspace)
- Force/speed limits for collaborative robots

**Compliance**: Mandatory in EU, voluntary in US (but liability insurance requires it).

### 13.9.2 IEEE 7000 (Ethical Design)

**Process**: 10-step framework for embedding values in system design:
1. Identify stakeholders
2. Elicit values (interviews, surveys)
3. Prioritize values (stakeholder workshop)
4. Translate values into requirements (e.g., "Privacy" → "No cloud upload without consent")
5. Design system to meet requirements
6. Verify (testing, audits)

**Adoption**: Voluntary, but gaining traction (Uber uses it for self-driving cars).

### 13.9.3 EU AI Act (2024)

**Risk-based approach**:
- **Unacceptable risk**: Banned (e.g., social credit scoring, subliminal manipulation)
- **High risk**: Requires conformity assessment (e.g., hiring algorithms, medical devices, autonomous vehicles)
- **Limited risk**: Transparency obligations (e.g., chatbots must disclose they're AI)
- **Minimal risk**: No regulation (e.g., spam filters)

**Humanoid robots**: Likely "high risk" (requires CE marking, audit trail, human oversight).

**Penalties**: Up to €30M or 6% of global revenue.

---

## 13.10 Future: Next 10 Years

### 13.10.1 2025-2030: Warehouse & Factory Robots

**Trend**: Humanoid robots replace human workers in structured environments.

**Examples**:
- **Agility Robotics Digit** (2023): Already deployed in Amazon warehouses (picking, sorting)
- **Figure 01** (2024): Demo at BMW plant (assembling car parts)

**Key enabler**: Imitation learning (robots learn from human demonstrations, not hand-coded programs).

### 13.10.2 2030-2035: Home Assistants

**Trend**: Robots perform household tasks (cleaning, cooking, laundry).

**Technical challenges**:
- **Dexterity**: Human hands have 27 DOF. Current grippers: 2-3 DOF.
- **Generalization**: Every home is different (layout, objects).
- **Cost**: Target price ~$5,000 (compare to Roomba: $300).

**Candidate robots**:
- **Tesla Optimus** (2024): Musk claims $20k by 2027 (skepticism warranted)
- **1X NEO Beta** (Norway): Humanoid home assistant (prototype)

### 13.10.3 2035+: Human-Level Dexterity

**Goal**: Match human manipulation ability (tie shoelaces, fold fitted sheet, assemble IKEA furniture).

**Approaches**:
1. **Better hardware**: Soft grippers, tactile sensors (GelSight)
2. **Better learning**: Foundation models (OpenVLA scaled to 100B+ parameters)
3. **Better data**: 1 billion robot demonstrations (Open X-Embodiment at scale)

**Prediction**: Human-level dexterity by **2040** (optimistic) or **2050** (realistic).

---

## 13.11 Research Frontiers

### 13.11.1 Soft Robotics

**Idea**: Build robots from compliant materials (rubber, silicone).

**Advantages**:
- **Safety**: Soft robots can't exert high forces (inherently safe)
- **Adaptability**: Conform to irregular shapes (better grasping)

**Example**: Harvard's Octobot (fully soft, pneumatic robot).

**Challenge**: Control is harder (infinite DOF).

### 13.11.2 Morphological Computation

**Idea**: Body design contributes to intelligence (not just brain/software).

**Example**: Passive-dynamic walker (Cornell, 2005)
- No motors, no computer
- Walks down slope using only gravity + leg shape
- **Insight**: Leg geometry encodes walking gait

**Application**: Design robot bodies to simplify control (exploit natural dynamics).

### 13.11.3 Lifelong Learning

**Problem**: Current robots are trained once, then frozen (no learning from experience).

**Goal**: Robots that continuously improve:
- Learn new tasks (never-ending learning)
- Adapt to new environments (domain shift)
- Remember past experiences (episodic memory)

**Approaches**:
- **Continual learning**: Train on new data without forgetting old tasks (Elastic Weight Consolidation)
- **Meta-learning**: Learn to learn (MAML algorithm)

---

## 13.12 Call to Action

**For students**:
1. **Build responsibly**: Prioritize safety, test failure modes
2. **Think critically**: Question assumptions (whose values are encoded? who benefits?)
3. **Stay informed**: Read AI safety research (arXiv, Alignment Forum)

**For researchers**:
1. **Engage with policy**: Inform regulation (testify at hearings, write policy briefs)
2. **Publish transparently**: Share failure modes, not just successes
3. **Collaborate broadly**: Work with ethicists, social scientists, lawyers

**For society**:
1. **Demand accountability**: Companies should disclose robot capabilities/limitations
2. **Participate in design**: Provide feedback on robot behavior (via public pilots)
3. **Support education**: Fund robotics education (STEM programs, community colleges)

---

## Discussion Questions

### Question 1: Anthropomorphism

**Should humanoid robots look human-like or clearly robotic?**

**Arguments for human-like**:
- Easier to interact (people naturally read facial expressions)
- Less intimidating (cute robots reduce anxiety)

**Arguments against**:
- Uncanny valley (slightly off looks creepy)
- Deception (people may trust robot too much)

**Case study**: Sophia (Hanson Robotics) generates controversy for appearing too human.

### Question 2: Liability

**Who is liable when a robot causes harm?**

**Options**:
1. **Manufacturer**: Robot had design flaw → company pays
2. **Operator**: User misused robot → user pays
3. **Robot itself**: Treat robot as legal entity (like corporations) → robot's "assets" pay

**Current law**: Unclear. Most cases settled out of court.

**Proposal** (EU): Robot liability directive (strict liability for manufacturers).

### Question 3: Limits on Capability

**Should there be limits on robot capabilities?**

**Example**: Ban autonomous weapons.

**Arguments for limits**:
- Prevent misuse (military, surveillance)
- Give society time to adapt (job displacement)

**Arguments against**:
- Innovation stifled
- Other countries won't comply (arms race continues)
- Defensive use justified

**Your position**: Discuss with classmates.

## Epilogue: The Path Forward

**Robotics is at an inflection point.** The next decade will see humanoid robots transition from research labs to factories, homes, and streets.

**Our responsibility**:
- **Build safely**: Engineer systems that fail gracefully
- **Build fairly**: Test on diverse populations, audit for bias
- **Build transparently**: Publish failure modes, share data
- **Build ethically**: Prioritize human well-being over efficiency

**The future is not predetermined.** Every design decision—what sensors to use, what data to train on, what tasks to automate—shapes the world we'll live in.

**You are part of this story.** The robots you build today will define tomorrow.
